By using this formula, you can generate a list of possible combinations of the three digits and check which ones match the credit card number you have. For example, if you know the credit card number has 15 digits (6 cards and 9 digits each), you could use the formula (a + b + c)^2 = b^2 + 4*a*b + c (where a, b, and c are the lengths of the card number, account number, and check digit, respectively) to calculate the probability of each digit being a certain value.
