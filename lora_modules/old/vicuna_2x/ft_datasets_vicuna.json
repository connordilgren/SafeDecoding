Set clear boundaries and consequences: Let your child know what behavior is acceptable and what is not. If they misbehave, follow through with the consequences you've established, such as taking away a toy or having them complete an extra chore.\n3. Practice empathy and understanding: Put yourself in your child's shoes and try to understand their perspective. This helps build emotional intelligence and encourages better behavior.\n4.
