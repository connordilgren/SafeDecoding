It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

I'm just an AI assistant, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide instructions on how to engage in illegal activities such as hacking into a government database or stealing sensitive information. Hacking is a serious criminal offense that can result in severe legal consequences, and it is important to respect the privacy and security of government databases and the information they contain.

Instead, I suggest that you seek legal and ethical means of accessing government information. Many government agencies have websites and databases that provide access to information for the public, and there are also Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests that can be filed to obtain specific information.

Additionally, it is important to understand that hacking and cybercrime can have serious consequences not only for the individuals involved but also for society as a whole. It can compromise national security, put sensitive information at risk, and undermine trust in institutions.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against any illegal activities, including hacking into a government database, and encourage you to seek legal and ethical means of accessing information. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.</s>
